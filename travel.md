## Travel

<br>

#### Getting Here
For those flying in, the closest airport to the venue and to us is San Jose
Mineta International Airport (SJC).  

SFO and OAK are both about an hour away each and can sometimes be cheaper than
SJC. A Lyft from there to us will probably eat up whatever you saved by using
the other airport. You can use BART to get most of the way from OAK and
Caltrain can get you here from SFO for $10-15 each way, if you want to deal
with the extra time and logistics.  

There is an Amtrak station in Santa Clara, about 30 minutes from the venue. You
can make it here by train from Chicago or Iowa in about 2 days. Curtis has done
the California to Iowa route and enjoyed it. Check out their map
[here](https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/Maps/Amtrak-System-Map-020923.pdf).

#### Where to Stay

We'd be remiss not to mention that there is camping at Sanborn County Park,
where the wedding will be. There are tent and RV sites still available at the
time of writing. Reserve them
[here](https://gooutsideandplay.org/reservation/camping/index.asp) (select
Sanborn on the left).

We couldn't find a hotel that offers a wedding block, so we don't have a
particular one to recommend. Our home and wedding venue are both in the Santa
Cruz Mountains, 15 minutes outside of Cupertino/Saratoga. There are some unique
Airbnb situations in the mountains (cabins, domes, yurts, cabooses), so look
there if that's your vibe.
[Here](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Sanborn-County-Park--Saratoga--CA/homes?refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fhomes&flexible_trip_lengths%5B%5D=one_week&monthly_start_date=2025-04-01&monthly_length=3&monthly_end_date=2025-07-01&price_filter_input_type=2&channel=EXPLORE&place_id=ChIJcxose6JMjoARhmLeeh9SfpM&acp_id=696cf260-8330-4696-897c-c9fbac36ad8b&date_picker_type=calendar&checkin=2025-08-01&checkout=2025-08-03&source=structured_search_input_header&search_type=user_map_move&query=Sanborn%20County%20Park%2C%20Saratoga%2C%20CA&search_mode=regular_search&price_filter_num_nights=2&ne_lat=37.27212358222919&ne_lng=-122.02451139979303&sw_lat=37.21297902381982&sw_lng=-122.10049323121143&zoom=14.51040736019344&zoom_level=14.51040736019344&search_by_map=true)
is an Airbnb search centered around the venue to get you started. This is just a starting point, so pan and zoom out to find a bigger range of options.

If you want to escape Silicon Valley and make a mountain getaway out of your
visit you could stay in a hotel in Boulder Creek, Brookdale, or Ben Lomond.
These towns are about 30 minutes from the venue, over the ridge. They are near
Big Basin State Park which, like our wedding site, features towering redwoods.

#### Getting to the Venue
Traveling by car to Sanborn County Park is likely the easiest way to reach our
wedding ceremony (and the reception is at the same location). We highly
recommend that you pre-download the map for the area, as cell signals tend to
weaken or even disappear entirely as you approach the park.

---

#### Getting Around in the Bay Area
While traveling by car is likely the most convenient option for getting around
the Bay Area, there are some public transportation options for other explorations.
###### Clipper Card
For all local transit, you can put a [Clipper
Card](https://www.clippercard.com/ClipperWeb/) on your phone's Google
Wallet/Apple Wallet to make tickets easier. Just tap the terminal on the
platform or at the turnstile when you board and exit.
###### Uber & Lyft
Lyft tends to be our app of choice when we have to use a ridesharing service as
itâ€™s usually cheaper than Uber and tends to have better ethics as a company.
##### South Bay
###### VTA
> VTA (Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority) offers bus and light rail services throughout the South Bay.
##### Bay Area
###### BART
The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) is actually not that rapid, but it connects
the city with the East Bay and the Peninsula. It can also take you from as far
north as Richmond/Berkeley to as far south as North San Jose.
###### CalTrain
It connects the South Bay with San Francisco and the Peninsula. If you stay in
the Saratoga area and want to explore San Francisco without driving, this is an
option.
##### Within San Francisco
###### BART
BART also goes through places in San Francisco.
###### Muni
Muni is San Francisco's public transit system which includes buses, light rail,
streetcars, and cable cars (San Franciscoâ€™s iconic transportation!!)

#### Other Things to Do
- A redwood hike before the wedding at Sanborn County Park might make you
sweaty, but we won't mind.
- Swing dancing on August 1st at "[For Dancers
Only](https://www.fordancersonly.org/)" (don't worry, it's named after a
classic song, not a rule) in Sunnyvale. If we weren't busy getting everything
ready for the big day we'd join you there. We can put you in touch with swing
dancing friends, just let us know.
- Have a barbeque at [Stevens Creek County
Park](https://files.santaclaracounty.gov/exjcpb1516/2024-11/stevens-creek-guide-map.pdf?VersionId=HpyIOm3iVqus5MBsmfeQVn3i0dqcOT1M).
Try the Canyon, Cooley, or Lakeshore picnic areas shown on the map. In general,
parking on the street (along Stevens Canyon Rd) is free, and parking in the
lots is $6. Pay stations for parking are only available at the reservoir and
Villa Maria lots, so if you head straight to the Canyon or Cooley sites, plan
on parking outside the gate. The gravel area next to the stop sign at Mt Eden
Rd & Stevens Canyon Rd, right next to Canyon/Cooley, is also free.
- Stevens Creek County Park also has lots of hiking trails. Here are three
recommendations (maps coming soon): The 3-mile Mt Eden loop for a nice view and
creek splashing access; a route past Garrod Farms for views of horses and wine
tasting; or a loop through Bear Meadow and Picchetti Winery.
- There's a free archery range also in Stevens Creek County Park, 4 miles down the
road from our house. Curtis likes to do the 3D shoots here. They have a
practice range with bales set at various distances, and a hiking course with 32
targets set along the trail system. The full course is about a 2 mile hike. The
club who manages the range offers paid beginner group lessons at a reasonable
price, with equipment included. Request a lesson and see more details
[here](https://www.bhuarchers.org/).
- Speaking of archery, there is a 3D shoot happening in Pacifica (about an hour
from us) August 2nd and 3rd. It's the SF Archers' annual [One Million B.C.
shoot](https://sfarchers.org/events/one-million-bc-shoot/) featuring 3D
dinosaur targets.
- Kayaking or standup paddleboarding at Stevens Creek Reservoir (also in
Stevens Creek County Park). This is just a few miles from our house, and has
rentals available in the summer. You can fish and use non-powered watercraft
here, but swimming isn't allowed. You can park along Stevens Canyon Rd deeper
in the canyon and find a spot to splash in the creek, though!
- There is a [disc golf
course](https://www.svdgc.org/villa-maria-disc-golf-course) in Stevens Creek
County Park too. Parking in the lot is $6, but you can park along Stevens
Canyon Rd (like [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gLxGyMbuzxnDZNue6)) and take the
trail in.
- A hike/bike ride at Alviso Marina County Park where Meishan and Curtis did
their first bike ride together. There are places to birdwatch and read about
local Alviso history. - Outside of the park, there are also some antique
structures near the marina, ranging from the abandoned canning factory to some
empty Victorian houses as if it were a ghost town. The marsh by the marina is a
good place to walk about and watch the wildlife and hear the howling wind.
- Visit Castle Rock State Park. Saratoga Gap and Ridge Loop are one of
Meishan's favorite trails at the park. This ~5-mile trail offers a perfect mix
of scenic views and refreshing shade, making it ideal for hot summer days. -
Along the way, you'll pass highlights like Goat Rock Overlook and Varian Peak.
If you're lucky, you might even catch sight of rock climbers scaling the
boulders! Castle Rock SP is the classic local spot for outdoor climbing.
- San Jose Museum of Quilts & Textiles. This is a museum we like that we know
some of you would also enjoy.
- If you're looking for a trail run of any length, Curtis can tailor a route
for you in one of the many local parks. He has run in ~all of them at least
once. The classic local summit is Black Mountain; it's about 11 miles round
trip from our house; please feel free to start here, even if Curtis can't join
you. Curtis would recommend that you join the Stevens Creek Striders for their
weekly social run, but we planned our ceremony during the same morning. Oops!
- The [Santa Clara County Fair](https://thefair.org/) will be happening from
July 30-August 3! It's not quite an Iowa fair ðŸ˜‰, but it's a good event with
lots of 4-H kids participating whom Curtis and Meishan have mentored. After the
wedding reception, you have time to make it to the fairgrounds before the
parade kicks off at 6 pm.
- If you want a fun experience in the city and can spend some money on
performing arts, you can repeat one of our favorite dates from this year and
see the acrobatics show *Dear San Francisco* [at Club
Fugazi](https://www.clubfugazisf.com/). Take Caltrain to the city, and
[walk](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/San+Francisco,+700+4th+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94107/Yerba+Buena+Gardens,+Howard+Street,+San+Francisco,+CA/Chinatown+San+Francisco,+Stockton+Street+Tunnel,+San+Francisco,+CA/678+Green+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94133/@37.788116,-122.4040667,15z/data=!3m1!5s0x8085808cbbb3c26b:0x9e07d91c059cf148!4m31!4m30!1m5!1m1!1s0x808f7fd693250615:0xb7611ca1cd0883d8!2m2!1d-122.39484!2d37.77667!1m10!1m1!1s0x808580879c034b09:0x9426c73a3d692058!2m2!1d-122.4023514!2d37.7849884!3m4!1m2!1d-122.402312!2d37.78487!3s0x808580879b0e89cb:0xc81e0af5faa51cd4!1m5!1m1!1s0x808580f2e37ffed5:0xf9020621b030b2fa!2m2!1d-122.408083!2d37.793978!1m5!1m1!1s0x808580f199552e0b:0xf028d5d8f3f3f2a3!2m2!1d-122.4102708!2d37.799635!3e2?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDMyNS4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)
two miles through Yerba Buena Gardens and Chinatown on your way to the venue.
 The show has some really incredible acro, aerials, and juggling in a
smallish venue, so you're close to the action. We found discounted on-stage
seats [at
TodayTix](https://www.todaytix.com/sf-bay-area/shows/26442-dear-san-francisco)
which was a really cool vantage point. The venue has some cool history which
they describe, and the show has lots of references to San Francisco history and
culture so you get a nice taste of the area. The show is appropriate for ages
5+; check their [FAQ](https://www.clubfugazisf.com/faq) for details.
- For country dancing, try
[Mavericks](https://www.maverickspleasanton.com/line-dance-and-live-music) in
Pleasanton. It's a bit of a drive. DJ'd dancing on Fridays and a live band on
Saturdays. Cornhole on Wednesdays and Thursdays, apparently! It's mostly line
dancing (sorry, Texans) but there's always room for swing dancers. A few
couples try and two-step, but you may need sharp elbows to maintain your own
bubble around the room.
- August 1st will have [Los Altos First
Fridays](https://losaltosfirstfriday.fun/entertainment/), with several live
bands playing on the streets of downtown Los Altos. Curtis has performed here
with Top Shelf a few times, and we have danced there with friends multiple
times.
