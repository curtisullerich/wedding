#### Getting to the Venue
Traveling by car to Sanborn County Park is likely the easiest way to reach our
wedding ceremony. We highly recommend that you pre-download the map for the
area, as cell signals tend to weaken or even disappear entirely as you approach
the park.

#### Getting Around in the Bay Area
While traveling by car is likely the most convenient option for getting around
the Bay Area, there are some public transportation options for other explorations.
###### Uber & Lyft
Lyft tends to be our app-of-choice as it’s usually cheaper than Uber and we
earn 10x points with Meishan’s Chase credit card, but we've heard that Uber
offers deals with American Express credit cards.
##### South Bay
###### VTA
> VTA (Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority) offers bus and light rail services throughout the South Bay.
##### Bay Area
###### BART
The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) is actually not that rapid, but it connects
the city with the East Bay and the Peninsula. It can also take you from as far
north as Richmond/Berkeley to as far south as North San Jose.
###### CalTrain
It connects the South Bay with San Francisco and the Peninsula. If you stay in
the Saratoga area and want to explore San Francisco without driving, this is an
option.
##### Within San Francisco
###### BART
BART also goes through places in San Francisco.
###### Muni
Muni is the city's public transit system includes buses, light rail,
streetcars, and cable cars (San Francisco’s iconic transportation!!)

#### Other Things to Do
- A hike before the wedding at Sanborn County Park might make you sweaty, but we won't mind.  
- Swing dancing on August 1st at "For Dancers Only" (don't worry, it's named
after a classic song, not a rule) in Sunnyvale.  
- A hike/bike ride at Alviso Marina County Park where Meishan and Curtis did
their first bike ride together. There are places to birdwatch and read about
local Alviso history. - Outside of the park, there are also some antique
structures near the marina, ranging from the abandoned canning factory to some
empty Victorian houses as if it were a ghost town. The marsh by the marina is a
good place to walk about and watch the wildlife and hear the howling wind.  
- Visit Castle Rock State Park. Saratoga Gap and Ridge Loop are one of
Meishan's favorite trails at the park. This ~5-mile trail offers a perfect mix
of scenic views and refreshing shade, making it ideal for hot summer days. -
Along the way, you'll pass highlights like Goat Rock Overlook and Varian Peak.
If you're lucky, you might even catch sight of rock climbers scaling the
boulders!  
- San Jose Museum of Quilts & Textiles  
- If you're looking for a trail run of any length, Curtis can tailor a route
for you in one of the many local parks. He has run in ~all of them at least
once.
