## Getting to the Venue
Traveling by car to get to Sanborn County Park is likely the easiest way to reach our wedding ceremony. We highly recommend that you pre-download the map for the area, as cell signals tend to weaken or even disappear entirely as you approach the park.

## Getting Around in the Bay Area
While traveling by car is likely the most convenient option for getting around the Bay Area, there are some public transportation options available as well.
###### Uber & Lyft
Lyft tends to be our app-of-choice as it’s usually cheaper than Uber and we earn 10x points with Meishan’s Chase credit card, but we've heard that Uber offers deals with American Express credit cards.
#### South Bay
###### VTA
> VTA (Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority) offers bus and light rail services throughout the South Bay.
#### Bay Area
###### BART
The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) is actually not that rapid as how it's named, but it connects the city with the East Bay and the Peninsula. It can also take you from as far north as Richmond/Berkeley to as far south as North San Jose.
###### CalTrain
It connects the South Bay with San Francisco and the Peninsula. It's a convenient option for guests coming from the north.
#### Within San Francisco
###### BART
BART also goes through places in San Francisco.
###### Muni
Muni is the city's public transit system includes buses, light rail, streetcars, and cable cars (San Francisco’s iconic transportation!!)

## Other Things to Do
- A hike before the wedding at Sanborn County Park probably wouldn’t be a bad idea?  
- Swing Dancing Friday night at For Dancer Only in Sunnyvale.  
- A hike/bike ride at Alviso Marina County Park. There are places to birdwatch, read about local Alviso history. - Outside of the park, there are also some antique structures near the marina, ranging from the abandoned canning factory to some empty rotten Victorian houses as if it were a ghost town. The marsh by the marina is a good place to walk about and watch the wildlife and hear the howling wind.  
- Visit Castle Rock State Park. Saratoga Gap and Ridge Loop are one of my favorite trails at the park. This ~5-mile trail offers a perfect mix of scenic views and refreshing shade, making it ideal for hot summer days. - Along the way, you'll pass highlights like Goat Rock Overlook and Varian Peak. If you're lucky, you might even catch sight of rock climbers scaling the cliffs!  
- San Jose Museum of Quilts & Textiles
