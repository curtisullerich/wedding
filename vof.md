## Appreciation Time!
<br>
Our friends Doug and Olivia met us for a camping trip at Valley of Fire State
Park in November 2024. Doug picked the location, which was new to all of us. It
was amazing. I (Curtis) have always loved Doug's photos and photography has
always been a big part of our trips together. We're both so grateful for
another fun camping trip with Doug and Olivia, this time with the camera turned
our direction.  

Here are some behind-the-scenes photos from that weekend.
