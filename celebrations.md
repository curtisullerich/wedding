## Day-After Hangout

<!-- need to change the day after hang out location -->
***Casual Attire***  
***Location: TBD***  
We know that our wedding day will be hectic yet filled with joy and
celebrations, and as much as we'd love to, we may not get enough time to catch
up with each of you. That's why we are planning a relaxing day-after hangout
hoping to spend some quality time with you, chatting, and connecting with
everyone who's made the time and effort to join us for this special occasion in
our life.
