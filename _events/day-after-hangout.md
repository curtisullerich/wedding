### Day-After Hangout
***Sunday, August 3rd, 2025***  
***Casual Attire***    
***Location: [San Pedro Square Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hY6AxTBcWCHYjiJz7) in downtown San Jose***  
We know that our wedding day will be joyful but hectic. To get more quality
time with all of you, we're planning a simple day-after hangout for anyone
still in town on Sunday. Join us at the San Pedro Square Market in downtown San
Jose any time between 11 and 1:30. Buy some lunch from one of the many
counter-serve restaurants and join us at the outdoor seating. Come and go as
fits your schedule, no need to arrive at a specific time. Park on the street
(free on Sundays) or one of the city garages (free for the first 90 minutes).  
San Pedro Square Market is one of Meishan's favorite places to eat on the rare
occasion when we dine out, and we usually go when there is live swing music
playing.
