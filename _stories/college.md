### Day-After Hangout

We know that our wedding day will be hectic yet filled with joy and celebrations, and as much as we'd love to, we may not get enough time to catch up with each of you.
That's why we are planning a relaxing day-after hangout hoping to spend some quality time with you, chatting, and connecting with everyone who's made the time and effort to join us for this special occasion in our life.

Join us please by RSVP [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdpiyH0sd4itq2MerhRT2WL9WInMPvOhqgHUgqBeTqUPvuZOQ/viewform?usp=header)!
