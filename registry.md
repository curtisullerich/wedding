## Registry
<br>

###### Surprise! We're not doing one.  
<br>
We know that attending a wedding can be expensive for guests both in time and
money, and the gift of your presence is all that's necessary. We're blessed to
already have the housewares we need, so a traditional registry wouldn't be
helpful anyway. If you want to give a gift, we are working toward building a
family-sized home on our current property, on the other corner of the lot from
our current just-Curtis-and-Meishan-sized home; we would be grateful for gifts to accelerate
that process, or please feel encouraged to join for a deconstruction or
building day in the canyon!
