## FAQ  
<br>

##### When is the RSVP deadline?
Please RSVP by June 30th, 2025.
<!-- TODO update -->

##### Can I bring a date?
We’re excited to have you share this special day with us!  
If you’d like to bring a date who is not listed on the invitation, please put
in this information in your RSVP.

##### Can I bring my children?
Why not? They are adorable!
<!-- TODO update -->

##### What should I wear?
Cocktail attire; we will be outdoors, so consider sunglasses and even a hat.
We're not picky about colors, but if you like to color coordinate, consider
taking inspiration from the redwood trees that will surround us. See color
examples below.

##### What kind of shoes should I wear?
The picnic area is not paved, and you may even find yourselves on grass at some
point. We recommend wearing comfortable shoes, and no stilettos.

##### What will the weather be like?
In August, the weather in Saratoga, CA might be a subject of debate -- Meishan
thinks it’s just warm enough, Curtis might argue it’s going to be a bit hot. So
here are some numbers to help you decide:  
The average high temperature is around 79°F (26°C), and the average low
temperature is about 55°F (13°C). It’s generally dry with very little chance of
rain. 
<!-- TODO update this in mid-July -->

##### What’s the parking situation like?
There's a parking lot very close to our reserved site. All lots in the park at
$6/vehicle. Curtis & Meishan will pre-purchase a parking pass for every RSVP we
receive. We'll have a friend hand them to you as your drive into the park.  
If you're running late or a mixup happens, having $6 cash on hand will get you
in, and we are more than happy to reimburse you. The nearest free parking is
along Sanborn Rd, half a mile from the park entrance.  
We recommend arriving 20-30 minutes before the ceremony begins at 11:00 AM, so
you can park and get settled on the deck.  

##### Is there cell service in the park?
It's spotty. There's wifi in the park, which is also spotty.

##### Will there be dancing?
We are huge fans of swing dancing! One of our favorite repeat dates is to dance
to live outdoor music by the Top Shelf Big Band (and Curtis has subbed for
rehearsals and gigs with TSBB many times) so we asked them to come play during
our reception.  
Between the ceremony and reception, a friend will be teaching a very basic
swing dance lesson for anyone who is interested. No experience or partner
necessary. Meishan learned the basics from Curtis on just their first date, and
this teacher will be better than Curtis.  

##### Can I take pictures?
We kindly ask that you do not take photos during the ceremony, as we will have
a professional photographer capturing those special moments. To ensure the
ceremony runs smoothly, please turn off your cell phone to avoid any
interruptions, but take as many as you’d like during the reception.

##### What if I have food allergies?
Our wedding will be nut-free and shellfish-free, but if you have any other food
restrictions, please let us know in your RSVP, and we’ll do our best to
accommodate them.

##### Are the ceremony and reception locations wheelchair accessible?
For the ceremony, the area is wheelchair accessible. However, the covered area
for the reception is not wheelchair accessible.

##### What time will the reception end?
An hour or two before sunset.
<!-- TODO make a more specific decision. when will the band leave? -->
