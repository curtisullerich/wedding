##### What kind of shoes should I wear?
The picnic area is not paved. We recommend wearing comfortable shoes, and no stilettos.

##### What will the weather be like?
In August, Saratoga, CA might be a subject of debate, while Meishan thinks it’s
just warm enough, Curtis might argue it’s going to be so hot! So let’s take a look
at the facts and see what you think about it.  
The average high temperature is
around 79°F (26°C), and the average low temperature is about 55°F (13°C). It’s
generally dry with very little chance of rain. 

##### What’s the parking situation like?
Parking is available at the park for $6 per vehicle.  
Though the park has a limit on how many parking tickets we can pre-purchase, we hope we can have enough for everyone. 
One of our crew members will be waiting at the entrance to
hand them to you as you arrive.  
In case the tickets aren't enough, we are more than happy to reimburse you.  
Please be sure to arrive early to allow time to find parking and walk to the ceremony site.  
We recommend arriving 20-30 minutes before the ceremony begins at 11:00 AM.

##### Are there any signals in the park?
Call signals can be weak or even none.  
The park has Wi-Fi, but please note that
the connection may be spotty.

##### Will there be dancing?
We are huge fans of swing dancing!  
There will be a dance lesson during the
reception, where you’ll learn some basic swing moves. No experience or partners
are required,  just come ready to have fun!  

##### Can I take pictures?
We kindly ask that you do not take photos during the ceremony, as we will have
a professional photographer capturing those special moments. To ensure the
ceremony runs smoothly, please turn off your cell phone to avoid any
interruptions, but take as many as you’d like during the reception.

##### What if I have serious allergies?
Our wedding will be nut-free and shellfish-free, but if you have any other serious allergies, please let us know in your RSVP, and we’ll do our best to
accommodate them.

##### Are the ceremony and reception locations wheelchair accessible?
