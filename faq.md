## FAQ  
<br>

##### Where/when should I RSVP?
Please let us know whether or not you can make it [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/rsvp) by April 20th.

##### What if one day of fun isn't enough?
We're planning to have a casual day-after hangout on Sunday, August 3rd, to get
more quality time with everyone who came to celebrate with us. We'll update
this section with more details. If you need to know anything specific to aid
your planning, just get in touch.

##### Can I bring a date?
We’re excited to have you share this special day with us!  
If you’d like to bring a date who is not listed on the invitation, please put
in this information in your RSVP.

##### Can I bring my children?
Yes, children are welcome.

##### What should I wear?
Cocktail attire; we will be outdoors, so consider sunglasses, and even a hat
and sunscreen.  We're not picky about colors, but if you like to color
coordinate, consider taking inspiration from the redwood trees that will
surround us.

##### What kind of shoes should I wear?
The picnic area is not paved, and you may even find yourselves on grass at some
point. We recommend wearing comfortable shoes, and no stilettos.

##### What will the weather be like?
In August, the suitability of the weather in Saratoga, CA might be a subject of
debate -- Meishan thinks it’s just warm enough, Curtis might argue it’s going
to be a bit hot. So here are some numbers to help you decide:  
The average high temperature is around 79°F (26°C), and the average low
temperature is about 55°F (13°C). It’s generally dry with very little chance of
rain.
<!-- TODO update this in mid-July -->

##### What’s the parking situation like?
There's a parking lot very close to our reserved site. All lots in the park are
$6/vehicle. Curtis & Meishan will pre-purchase a parking pass for every RSVP we
receive. We'll have a friend hand them to you as you drive into the park.  
If you're running late or a mixup happens, having $6 cash on hand will get you
in, and we are more than happy to reimburse you. The nearest free parking is
along Sanborn Rd, half a mile from the park entrance.  
We recommend arriving 20-30 minutes before the ceremony begins, so you can park
and get settled.  

##### Is there cell service in the park?
It's spotty. There's wifi in the park, which is also spotty.

##### Will there be dancing?
We are huge fans of swing dancing! One of our favorite repeat dates is to dance
to live outdoor music by the Top Shelf Big Band (and Curtis has subbed on sax
for rehearsals and gigs with TSBB many times) so we asked them to come play
during our reception.  
Between the ceremony and reception, we'll coordinate a very basic swing dance
lesson for anyone who is interested. No experience or partner necessary.
Meishan learned the basics from Curtis on just their first date, and this
teacher will be better than Curtis.  

##### Can I take pictures?
We kindly ask that you do not take photos during the ceremony, as we will have
a professional photographer capturing those special moments. To ensure the
ceremony runs smoothly, please turn off your cell phone to avoid any
interruptions, but take as many as you’d like during the reception.

##### What if I have food allergies?
Our wedding will be nut-free and shellfish-free, but if you have any other food
restrictions, please let us know in your RSVP, and we’ll do our best to
accommodate them. We will have a vegan option available, but please let us know
about that in the RSVP so we can plan accordingly.

##### Are the ceremony and reception locations wheelchair accessible?
The ceremony and reception areas are wheelchair accessible. There are two steps
up to the gazebo area; we are still planning the layout, but we may have the
buffet line here. If you have any accessibility concerns or requests, please
note them in your RSVP or get in touch with us.

##### How long will the reception last?
The band will play for a couple hours after the luncheon.
