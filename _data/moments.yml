Jingshan bought a translator device and used it to have conversations with Curtis. Curtis really appreciated the effort Jingshan took to include him. Jingfeng thoughtfully chose vocabulary Curtis knew and spoke slowly so Curtis had a chance of understanding. Nephew Liran got a kick out of using the translator and had many conversations with Curtis too.
