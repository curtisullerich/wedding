Jingshan planned many outings for us and made the logistics of getting between Hong Kong and the mainland easy, and Curtis loved both of their cooking. Jingshan bought a translator device and used it to have conversations with Curtis. Curtis really appreciated the effort Jingshan took to include him. Jinfeng thoughtfully chose vocabulary Curtis knew and spoke slowly so Curtis had a chance of understanding. Nephew Liran got a kick out of using the translator and had many conversations with Curtis too. Curtis and Liwei were old friends at this point and used Cantonese for some simple things and English for the harder stuff like mathematical topography lessons."
