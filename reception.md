## Iowa Reception
***Friday, July 11th, 2025 at 16:00 AM***  
***Attire***   
***Location:*** <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Brun+Ko+Farm/@41.5870665,-95.0056998,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x87933355a8c1ee7b:0x1f694b9bdb51470c!8m2!3d41.5870625!4d-95.0031195!16s%2Fg%2F11cmdswhh1?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDIwNS4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">***Brun Ko Farm***</a>  

Please join us at Brun Ko Farm, the home of Emily and Nathan Paulsen, for our reception. While we’d love nothing more than to have you with us for our simple ceremony in California, we thought it’d make the most sense to come to Iowa and celebrate with you all instead of asking everyone to come to us. 

*If you are already planning to attend the Ohms reunion, you’ll be in just the right place at just the right time for our Iowa reception. :)
